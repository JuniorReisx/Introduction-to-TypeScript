# TypeScript Basics Project

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of TypeScript, showcasing various concepts such as primitive types, functions, arrays, classes, and more.

## Features

- **Primitive Types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `any`, `void`, `never`
- **Objects and Interfaces**: Creating and using interfaces with objects.
- **Arrays and Tuples**: Type-safe arrays and tuples.
- **Functions**: Functions with different argument types, async functions, and function overloading.
- **Classes**: Implementing basic classes with methods and access modifiers.
- **Working with Dates**: Using the `Date` object in TypeScript.
- **Array Methods**: Demonstrating common array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `some`, and `every`.
